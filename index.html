     <h2><strong>Education</strong></h2>

     <p1>On year 2005 was the year which i started schooling at joy primary
        school, by that time i was 4 years old.After compleating my <strong>
        ECD</strong>, i joined Lwombei primary school in vihiga.Actually vihiga
        was a very nice place  for me,my school was located on highlands
        sorrounded by hills.It was a very nice place for hunting animals like
        rabbits.I realy liked doing that during weakends.Apart from that i
        really liked climbing hills raching the highest point.After compleating
        my primary school, i joined Lwombei high school (<em>a neibouring
          school nearby.  </em>)</p1>
      <p2>Life in high school was good. I was once an assistant headboy.In
        high school the following were my best subjects ;
            <ol class="important">
                <li>Chemistry</li>
                <li>Physics</li>
                <li>Geography</li>
            </ol>
        of all the three Chemistry was my favorite. I managed to
        finish my form for and passed my <strong>KCSE</strong>KCSE though not
        that good.(C+).
       <h3>programming</h3>
     <p3><div class="programming">
        I decided to take programming because i had passion on software
        engineering.I used to try coding using You-tube as a guide.That was <thead>
        main reason why i joined Moringa after high school.I hope i will archive
        my dreams.
